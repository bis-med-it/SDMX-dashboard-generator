Welcome to SDMX Dashboard Generator's documentation!
====================================================

SDMX Dashboard generator is an open-source `Dash <https://dash.plotly.com>`_ application that generates dynamic dashboards by 
pulling data and metadata from SDMX Rest API. It supports the version 2.1 of the standard. It leverages the open-source 
library `SDMXthon <https://github.com/Meaningful-Data/sdmxthon>`_ to retrieve and parse data and metadata in SDMX. 
A dashboard is composed of several visualizations as defined by the specifications provided in a `.yaml` file.

This library has been developed for the `SDMX Hackathon Global Conference 2023 <https://www.sdmx2023.org/hackathon>`_.
