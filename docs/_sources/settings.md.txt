# Configuration

SDMX Dashboard Generator requires a YAML file with the settings for the dashboard. This file follows the specifications indicated by the [SDMX Hackathon Global Conference 2023 Terms of Reference](https://sdmx.org/wp-content/uploads/SDMX-Hackathon-2023-ToRrev.pdf).

## DashID
Any string composed of numbers, letters, and underscores (_) used to identify the dashboard. This ID will be used to compose the URL to display the dashboard. For example, if the base URL of the application is `https://mydomain/mybaseURL/` and the DashID is `MyDashboardID`, the dashboard might be displayed at `https://mydomain/mybaseURL/MyDashboardID`. 

## Row
An integer value 0…3 that indicates the row where the visual is to be located. Up to three charts can share the same row and they are to be distributed left-right in the order they appear in the specification file. A node with Row=0 and chartType=TITLE allows to define Title and Subtitle for the dashboard. Row=0 and chartType=FOOTER to specify up to two lines in Title and Sub-title nodes for the bottom of the dashboard.

## Title
A string with the title as specified in the YAML file. If no title is specified, the dashboard will automatically show the name of the requested dataflow. The latter supports translation.

## Subtitle
A string with the subtitle as specified in the YAML file. If `auto` is provided, the subtitle will be generated by taking the code name from `legendConcept`. If more than one code name is available, then it will take the first one and append to it `...`. If the subtitle node is empty, no subtitle will be shown.

## Unit
A string with the unit as specified in the YAML file. The unit can be show in the VALUE chart type next to the observation value if `UnitShow` is set to `Yes`.

## UnitIcon
A boostrap icon to be show on top of the VALUE chart.

## Decimals
Defines the number of decimals to display the observation value.

## chartType:
It can be VALUE, PIE, LINE and BAR:

TBA

## legendConcept

## legendLoc

## LabelsYN

## xAxisConcept
Indicates the concept to be allocated to the “x” axis, usually TIME_PERIOD for LINES. For BARS it indicates the dimension that define the bars.

## yAxisConcept
Indicates the concept to be allocated to the “y” axis, usually the observation value 
representing the MEASURE

## downloadYN
Possible values are Yes/No and indicates whether the download of the data behind the chart is allowed.

## dsdLink
An URL of an application or file containing related the datastructure data.

## metadataLink
An URL of an application or file containing reference metadata. If present, an 'i' icon is displayed below the title, and by clicking on it the link opens in an off-canvas.

## DATA
An URL of an application or file containing data.
