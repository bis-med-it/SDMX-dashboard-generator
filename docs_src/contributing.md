Any contribution is  **greatly appreciated**!

For uniform and clean code, please consider integrating [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) and [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) as part of your workflow.
A configuration for the former is already provided, and you can find a [good introduction here](https://medium.com/@huzaifazahoor654/improving-code-quality-with-flake8-and-black-a-guide-for-python-developers-c374168d5884).
