## Contributing

The SDMX Dashboard Generator (SDMX-DG) application has been originally developed by Cristina Stefana Leonte, Pietro Patelli, Stephan Probst and Olivier Sirello (Bank for International Settlements).

We encourage and invite everyone to contribute, as we firmly believe that the strength of our collaborative efforts is amplified by the unique perspectives and talents that each person brings to the table. We foster an inclusive environment where every member is recognized, respected, and empowered to contribute to our collective success.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs Using Github's [Issues](https://github.com/bis-med-it/SDMX-dashboard-generator/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track bugs.

If you spot a problem with the application, [search if an issue already exists](https://github.com/bis-med-it/SDMX-dashboard-generator/issues). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can [open a new issue](https://github.com/bis-med-it/SDMX-dashboard-generator/issues/new) and submit a bug report.

#### What to Include in a (Good) Bug Report?

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

### Suggesting Enhancements

Suggestions for new features and improvements are most welcome. Please [open an issue](https://github.com/bis-med-it/SDMX-dashboard-generator/issues/new) and label it **enhancement**.

- All ideas are welcome!
- Please be courteous and patient.
- Remember to include sufficient details and context.
- If you have multiple suggestions please submit them separately so we can track them.
- Screenshots are always helpful

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain the SDMX-DG's quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible SDMX-DG
- Enable a sustainable system for SDMX-DG maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Follow all instructions in [the template](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
2. Follow the [styleguides](#styleguides) integrating [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) and [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html). A configuration for the former is already provided, and you can find a [good introduction here](https://medium.com/@huzaifazahoor654/improving-code-quality-with-flake8-and-black-a-guide-for-python-developers-c374168d5884).
3. After you submit your pull request, verify that all [status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/) are passing <details><summary>What if the status checks are failing?</summary>If a status check is failing, and you believe that the failure is unrelated to your change, please leave a comment on the pull request explaining why you believe the failure is unrelated. A maintainer will re-run the status check for you. If we conclude that the failure was a false positive, then we will open an issue to track that problem with our status check suite.</details>
