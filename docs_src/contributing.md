## Contributing

The SDMX Dashboard Generator (SDMX-DG) application has been originally developed by Cristina Stefana Leonte, Pietro Patelli, Stephan Probst and Olivier Sirello (Bank for International Settlements). 

We encourage and invite everyone to contribute, as we firmly believe that the strength of our collaborative efforts is amplified by the unique perspectives and talents that each person brings to the table. We foster an inclusive environment where every member is recognized, respected, and empowered to contribute to our collective success.
